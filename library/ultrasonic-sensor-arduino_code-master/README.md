# ultrasonic-sensor-arduino_code
this code can be used to detect bojects and find obstacles using ultrasonic sensor along with arduino . this code can also be used to determine the distance of the obstacle from sensor.  connect trigger pin to A2 pin of arduino and echo pin to A3 pin of arduino and vcc to 5v and ground of sensor  to ground of arduino
